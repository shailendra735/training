my first commit 
Here i learnt to create a file in repository with a command

den add this to my repository
git add zeba.md
start zeba.md
git push origin master


I have learnt many markdown basics

1.You can use triple backticks (```) to format text as its own distinct block.

Check out this neat program I wrote:

```
x = 0
x = 2 + 2
what is x
```
2.You can make text bold or italic.

*This text will be italic*
**This text will be bold**
3.You can create a heading by adding one or more # symbols before your heading text. The number of # you use will determine the size of the heading.

# The largest heading (an <h1> tag)
## The second largest heading (an <h2> tag)
â€¦
###### The 6th largest heading (an <h6> tag)
