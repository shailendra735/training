 jscript does not have  classes 
 class functionality is accomplished by objet prototyes.
 
 its type are :
 number
 string
 boolean
 function 
 object
 symbol (unique immutable datatype used as an identifier)
 
scope is a set of rules for looking up variables with their identifier name.
reference error(scope resolution failure) 
type error(scope resolution was successful)

LHS(left hand side of an assignment):target of the assignment
RHS(right hand side of an assignment):source of the assignment

Lexial scope : Every inner level can access its outer levels.It is also called static scope.
void fun()
{
    int x = 5;

    void fun2()
    {
        printf("%d", x);
    }
}
Two mechanisms in JavaScript can "cheat" lexical scope: eval(..) and with.
  eval(.. )  modify existing lexical scope (at runtime) by evaluating a string of "code" which has one or more declarations in it. 
with is typically explained as a short-hand for making multiple property references against an object without repeating the object reference itself each time.
